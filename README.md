## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle weight,spoiler angle, and AWD the the coefficients that provied a non-random amount of variance. Vehicle length and groud clearance provided a random amount of variance to the mpg values.

The slope of the model will not be zero since vehicle weight,spoiler angle, and AWD effected the independent variable of MPG. The slope will be considered 0 if none of the coefficients had an effect on MPG.

Although not very accurate, the model can be used to predict mpg of prototypes due to the R-squared being .71 which is accurate about 71% of the time.
