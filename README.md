## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression mpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/145454872-62172b81-9234-40ef-8f04-c7f06845248a.png)


Vehicle weight,spoiler angle, and AWD the the coefficients that provied a non-random amount of variance. Vehicle length and groud clearance provided a random amount of variance to the mpg values.

The slope of the model will not be zero since vehicle weight,spoiler angle, and AWD effected the independent variable of MPG. The slope will be considered 0 if none of the coefficients had an effect on MPG.

Although not very accurate, the model can be used to predict mpg of prototypes due to the R-squared being .71 which is accurate about 71% of the time.

The overall variance of PSI of in the image above is 62.2 which is below the 100 PSI limit. The variance of PSI's for lot 1 and 2 are below the limit but the variance of the third lot is well over the limit.
